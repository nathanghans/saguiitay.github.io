My name is Itay Sagui. I'm a [programmer](http://www.github.com/saguiitay), and a books enthusiast. I currently work at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) in the [Israel R&D Center](http://microsoftrnd.co.il/) as a Senior Software Engineer. Before that, I was the VP of R&D at [Tzunami Inc.](http://www.tzunami.com). That being said, **this blog, its content and opinions are my own**.

I would love it if you would [subscribe to my blog's RSS feed]({{site.url}}feed.xml). I'm also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/saguiitay), [LinkedIn](http://il.linkedin.com/in/saguiitay/) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/saguiitay)

If you just want to email me, go ahead and send me an email to [saguiitay@hotmail.com](mailto:saguiitay@hotmail.com).
