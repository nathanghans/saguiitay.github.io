My name is Itay Sagui. I'm a [programmer](http://www.github.com/saguiitay), and a books enthusiast. I work at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) as a Senior Software Engineer. Before that, I was the VP of R&D  at [Tzunami Inc.](http://www.tzunami.com), but **this blog, its content and opinions are my own**.
