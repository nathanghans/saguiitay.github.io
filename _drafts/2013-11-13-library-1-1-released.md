The new version of [Library](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com/windows-phone/library/) - my Windows Phone app for managing books collection - is live in the Store. You can go ahead and download it from [here](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=01f350f2-01d1-4210-a83b-9874b71e9496). What's new, you're asking? Well, the release contains mostly bug fixes and minor UI improvements. I've also added [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/) as a source for books import. This should result in more reliable imports, with more complete books and author details. Â
