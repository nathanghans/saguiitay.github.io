As I've shown in my serie of  posts (Part [1](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/bloomberg-billionaires/ "Bloomberg Billionaires"), [2](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/bloombergs-billionaires-part-2-general-data-and-stats/ "Bloomberg’s Billionaires – Part 2: General data and stats"), [3](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/bloombergs-billionaires-part-3-getting-images/), [4](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/bloombergs-billionaires-part-4-accessing-billionaires-details-data/)), retrieving the information from Bloomberg's Billionaires web-app is quite simple. This all culminated to the creation of a Windows Phone app that gives users a peek into the Top 100 billionaires right out on their phone. The App features:

-   List of the Top 100 Billionaires (by name, ranking or industry)
-   Detailed information on each billionaire
-   Ability to Pin billionaires to the homepage, for quick access

Here are some screenshots of the app: [gallery ids="491,492,494"] You can download the app from the Windows Phone Store here:
