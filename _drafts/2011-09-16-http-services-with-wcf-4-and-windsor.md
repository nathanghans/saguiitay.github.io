Although a bit old, I found the following article, [Vanilla Yet Composable HTTP Services With WCF 4 and Windsor](http://codebetter.com/howarddierking/2010/01/19/vanilla-yet-composable-http-services-with-wcf-4-and-windsor/), extremely helpful.
 The article shows how to easily create services, and have their dependencies automatically resolved by the [Windsor](http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx)container, with minimal changes.
