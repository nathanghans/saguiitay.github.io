<span style="font-family:arial;">You are once again invited to read, reply and vote on my new article at </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">CodeProject</span>](http://www.codeproject.com/)<span style="font-family:arial;">. The article demonstrates how to add unbound items to a bound ComboBox. The code uses a wrapper that implements the IList interface, and supply the ComboBox both the extra items, that are kept at the beginning of the drop-down list, and the normal items, taken from the DataSource. The article can be found here: </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/UnboundItemsComboBox.asp</span>](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/UnboundItemsComboBox.asp)<span style="font-family:arial;"> </span>
