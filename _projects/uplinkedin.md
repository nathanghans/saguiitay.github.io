UpLinkedIn is a Chrome Extension to "improve" the user experience when visiting [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com).

![](/images/uplinkedin-options.png)

The extension provides several capabilities:

## Profile page changes

* Display "complete" connections count (intead of LinkedIf default of 500+ when someone has more than 500 connections)
* Display contact information (Saving you from manually having to expend the Contact info in your contacts' profile)

## Endorsements

The endorsements in LinkedIn are a bit of a mess, and slow to load (slowing the whole page).

* Automatic expend skills (instead of the collapsed view, where you have "_See 25+_" to see all skills)
* Disable endorsing skills (in case you don't believe in endorsements, you can just remove those persky + signs)
* Display compact Endorsements (removed the list of people that endorsed each skills)

## Feed

* Remove sponsored posts from feed (think about this as an ads blocker)
* Remove 'People in your network have new connections' posts from feed (nobody's interested in those)
* Remove 'LinkedIn Pulse' posts from feed (in case you don't care about LinkedIn Pulse)

## Pages

* Remove Ads (think about this as an ads blocker)

## connections

* Rmove non-LinkedIn accounts from suggestions (LinkedIn cheat a bit in the process of adding new connections to your networks - they display people that don't
have a LinkedIn account, hoping you'll send them a request to join LinkedIn. That sucks!)
