After spending a long while updating my Trivia engine, and collecting new data for the game, I'm proud to announce that Movies Trivia 2.0 was released,
and is available for download in the Windows Phone Marketplace. In addition to the new backend engine, the new version includes fixes to multiple
bugs and performance issues.

That being said, the most exciting change is the addition of image questions - questions that contains an image, or that their answers are images:

This opens up a complete new set of questions in the game.

Lastly, as usual, I've added even more data in the game - 42 new movies, 64 additional actors, 34 taglines, 17 directors, 14 awards and 1884 relations - this means,
plenty of new questions!

You can download the new versions by clicking the image below:
