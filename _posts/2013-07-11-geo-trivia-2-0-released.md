I'm proud to announce that Geo Trivia 2.0 was released, and is available for download in the Marketplace. In addition to the new backend engine,
the new version includes fixes to multiple bugs and performance issues. However, the most exciting change is the addition of image questions - questions
that contains an image, or that their answers are images:

This opens up a complete new set of questions in the game.

Lastly, as usual, I've added even more data in the game - 194 flags and 53 POI images, as well as 6 new types of questions - this means plenty of
new questions! You can download the new versions by clicking the image below:
