TechEd 2008 is coming fast, and this year, I'll attend the developers conference.

Read more details on the [TechEd Developers 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2008/developer/default.mspx), 
and if you're interested in meeting me, drop me a line.

During the first week of June, I'll post details and photos of my whole experience in Orlando.
