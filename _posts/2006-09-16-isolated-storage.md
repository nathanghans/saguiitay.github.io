Although not a very technical article, you should read the following article by Peter Aitken: [Exploring .Net's Isolated Storage](http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,2002924,00.asp). The article doesn't go very deep, isn't very technical, and to tell the truth, I didn't find it a good read. However, it does provide a basic introduction to the very important subject of Isolated Storage.</span>
