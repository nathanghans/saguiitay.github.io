For those of you not familiar with Joel's writings, I strongly recommend that you sign up to his blog at
([www.joelonsoftware.com](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)), as well as read his column at [Inc.com](http://www.inc.com/).

Joel is an [amazing writer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=%26%2334%3BJoel%20Spolsky%26%2334%3B&tag=itaysa.googlepages.com-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325),
and owner of the FogCreek company. Even if none of the texts that Joel write is your cup-of-tea, 
his writing ability, and way of thinking should make you a devoted reader.
