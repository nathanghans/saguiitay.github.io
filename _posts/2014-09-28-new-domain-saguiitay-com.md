After running this blog on the free [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) for the last couple of years, I've decided that it's time for me to have my own domain,
and to start looking for another publishing platform.

As a first step, and in preparation for a future move, I've purchased my own domain, [saguiitay.com](http://saguiitay.com). This will be the primary domain
going forward (you will be automatically redirected if you reach hear using the old domain - [itaysagui.wordpress.com](http://itaysagui.wordpress.com).

In the near future, I'll decide on which platform to use. I'm tending towards using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the pages and images.
