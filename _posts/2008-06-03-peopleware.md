I've just finished to read [Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPeopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second%2Fdp%2F0932633439%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211652925%26sr%3D1-1&tag=itaysa.googlepages.com-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325),
by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. The first few chapters (essays) where great. However, as I dwelled deeper in the book, 
I've encountered myself feeling less and less interested.

Now, I understand that the book might be a bit out-dated (being written more than 20 years ago),
but the extra chapters in the 2nd edition were suppose to handle that.

Instead, they felt like the writers lost a bit of theeir touch - the original essays are amazingly written
(even those that were less relevant to me), but the new one were just "weaker".

Another thing that I felt, was that I am not really the right audience for this book.
Although I lead a team of several software engineers, I am not really a part of the Enterprise community/politics.
Our company, being somewhat smaller, more agile, and less "formal", does not fit in the corporate 
image that that the authors try to paint. 

Some of the mental adjustments that I had to make were just not that easy to make.

All-in-all, I believe the book is a good read, and I'd recommend it to at least some of my peers, 
but wouldn't insist that they read it too fanatically.
