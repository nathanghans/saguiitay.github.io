<span style="font-family:arial;">I've recently came across a nice post on C\# Frequently Asked Questions blog. In the post, they've shown a way to filter out, or (pre)process Win32 messages of a form. Let's have a look at the code, then weâ€™ll go through it.</span>

``` c#:html:nocontrols:nogutter
public class MyMessageFilter : IMessageFilter
{
    public bool PreFilterMessage(ref Message m)
    {
        // Intercept the left mouse button down message
        if (m.Msg == 513)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("WM_LBUTTONDOWN is: " + m.Msg);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

<span style="font-family:arial;">And in the form itself: </span>

``` c#:html:nocontrols:nogutter
public class mainForm : System.Windows.Forms.Form
{
    private MyMessageFilter msgFliter = new MyMessageFilter();

    public mainForm()
    {
        // Register message filter
        Application.AddMessageFilter(msgFliter);
    }
}
```

<span style="font-family:arial;">As you can see, we've started by creating a class that implements the IMessageFilter interface. Then we've added an instance of that class to the form, and in the constructor registered it. We can use the Application.RemoveMessageFilter() method to stop filtering messages using the specified filter. All the filter class does is handle the WM\_LBUTTONDOWN message. By returning true, we specify that we've handled the message, and there's no need of any further handling of it - meaning that no event will be sent. This technique can be used either as a way to handle specific messages, or just ignore certain messages. Other nice things to try is to catch the message only a certain amount of times, or to "hide" some of the messages when certain requirements are met. </span>
