Now, I'm not the best person to speak about documentation and openness is code and products, 
but every now and then I find myself raising an eyebrow about someone else's behavior: 

[Don't name the URL for a sub-site 'CON' in MOSS 2007 - mindykelly's blog](http://www.sharepointblogs.com/mindykelly/archive/2007/06/20/don-t-name-the-url-for-a-sub-site-con-in-moss-2007.aspx)
I don't complain that Microsoft don't allow the "CON" as the URL of a WSS/MOSS site. But people, 
how about making this a public knowledge. How about putting up a one-stop repository for all 
SharePoint limitation and restrictions?

Among the many sites that Microsoft pops-up every other week, I'd love to see a site that 
centralize all the information about naming convention and limitations in SharePoint. 
Starting from the list of invalid characters for any type of items, list of "illegal" endings (_files, -files, etc), invalid names and so on...
