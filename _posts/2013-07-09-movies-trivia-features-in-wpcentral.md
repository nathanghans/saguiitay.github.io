Movies Trivia was [featured in WPCentral](http://www.wpcentral.com/movies-trivia-windows-phone-only-thing-missing-popcorn) for the first time!
I am happy to see that the game is starting to get more traction, and being more visible to Windows Phone gamers. I will share the effects of
the article on the download numbers later on, as the dust settles down.

In the mean time, go ahead and [download the game](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=e46152fa-1cc8-44bd-a095-4e5ad590a055) from the Windows Phone Store,
and send me your feedback.
