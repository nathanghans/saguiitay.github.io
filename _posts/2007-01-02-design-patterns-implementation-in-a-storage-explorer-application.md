Although a bit old, I found the well-written, interesting article by Breman Sinaga, [Design Patterns Implementation in a Storage Explorer Application](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/design/sinagastorageexplorer.asp) to be an excellente piece of work, explaining about several design patterns, such as [Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern), [Observer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_design_pattern), [Adapter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) and [Template Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_design_pattern), and showing how to corperate them all together. The result looks like a well designed, well thought-of, tool.
