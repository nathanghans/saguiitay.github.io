<span style="font-family:arial;">Although a bit old, I found the well-written, interesting article by Breman Sinaga, </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">Design Patterns Implementation in a Storage Explorer Application</span>](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/design/sinagastorageexplorer.asp)<span style="font-family:arial;"> to be an excellente piece of work, explaining about several design patterns, such as </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">Strategy</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)<span style="font-family:arial;">, </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">Observer</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_design_pattern)<span style="font-family:arial;">, </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">Adapter </span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)<span style="font-family:arial;">and </span>[<span style="font-family:arial;">Template Method</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_design_pattern)<span style="font-family:arial;">, and showing how to corperate them all together. The result looks like a well designed, well thought-of, tool.</span>
