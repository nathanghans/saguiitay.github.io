Stuart Leek has an amazingly detailed post - [ASP.NET MVC 3: Integrating with the jQuery 
UI date picker and adding a jQuery validate date range validator](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stuartleeks/archive/2011/01/25/asp-net-mvc-3-integrating-with-the-jquery-ui-date-picker-and-adding-a-jquery-validate-date-range-validator.aspx) - 
about how to add support for a DateTime editor in MVC, including server/client validation and range validation.

This post is a great read, and I can easily see myself using his usage of IMetadataAware to implement many more functionalities, such as value format.
