It's been a while since I last updated this website. With my latest efforts in games development, I decided that it's time to refresh the design of this website.

Being hosted in Github Pages, I was looking for a Jekill template, and decided to look again at [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com)'s work - the same designer that create the previous template. Luckily for me, Michael created a beautiful
template named [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

The template provides multiple layouts, SEO optimized pages, responsive design, comments support, and a lot of structured data processing. I've encountered a couple of hiccups [https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Asaguiitay+is%3Aclosed](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Asaguiitay+is%3Aclosed)
- which Michael helped resolve promptly.

The new website contains multiple sections:

  - [Blog](/blog/)
  - [Projects](/projects/)
  - [Games](/games/)
