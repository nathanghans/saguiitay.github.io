Without me noticing, at the beginning of the month Movies Trivia crossed over the 20,000 downloads mark. It's been a while since I've updated it,
but this milestone pushed me to work on version 2.0. The new version will include several improvements, including:

- Updated game to support Windows Phone 8
- 2 new types of images-based questions - both questions and answers can now be images, instead of just text. Take a look at a sample screenshot:

- Even more data - I've added more movies, actors, taglines, awards, etc.
- Major performance and stability improvements

I'll keep you posted when this is officially released. In the mean time, I invite you to download Movies Trivia, and send my your feedback:
