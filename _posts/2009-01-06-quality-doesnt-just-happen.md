Judy McKay writes a very interesting article, [Quality Doesn't Just Happen](http://www.cio.com/article/112800/Quality_Doesn_rsquo_t_Just_Happen) 
about project management process, and how to place Quality front-and-center of a project lifecycle.

> A quality-focused team produces a better project in a shorter amount of time, every time, but you have to have the right people to make it happen.
> We won't need the heroes to ride in at the end to save the project if it's never in distress. A well-planned project with a quality focus won't be in crisis. 
> There may still be trade-off decisions, which is why we use risk-based testing to be sure we mitigate the highest risk first, but these can be informed 
> decisions with measurable consequences.

As I gain more experience, both as a developer, and a team leader, I try to learn from past mistakes, pickup good practice and processes. 
However, I still had to smile to myself and feel uncomfortable in my seat while reading some of this article. This is a good thing - it means I'm still learning!
