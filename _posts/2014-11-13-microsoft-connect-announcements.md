If you're reading this blog, chances are that you're a .Net developer. And this week was big for the .Net community.

Just how big you ask?

Well, Microsoft had their [Connect(); event](http://www.visualstudio.com/connect-event-live-vs), and made some big announcements in its first day:

 *  [Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=390465) are available
 *  The first public [preview of Visual Studio 2015 and .NET 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=517106) are available
 *  The .NET Framework is going [open source](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) and cross platform
 *  A free [Visual Studio Community 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518338) a new edition of Visual Studio that combines everything in all the Express products and adds extensibility support
 *  A bunch of [new improvements to Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/news/news-overview-vs)
 
You can read about everything announced in the proliferate blog posts:

Personally, I'm quite excited about the Visual Studio Community Edition and the .NET Framework going open source. Having Visual Studio available to
me for free, along with the free accounts that Azure provides is a real life saver. The opening of .NET Framework will hopefully make it more robust,
will increase contributions (and thus increase the speed of new features being implemented).

I can't wait to see what the second day of the event will look like.
