Bloomberg's website contains a little gem that allows you to view and analyst the [world's top billionaires](http://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/).
This site provides information on each of the top 100 billionaires, their history, net worth and analysis, news, etc.

The website was implemented with HTML, JavaScript and JSON, and displays fluent animation, charts and graphs, and is generally a pleasure to the eyes.

Why am I telling you all this? Unfortunately, no, I don't appear on that list... Since the website was implemented using Javascript, and the data is
in JSON, we can easily take a look under the hood, and learn about the implementation, and even use the data for our own purpose - and that's
exactly what I'll show in my next post.
